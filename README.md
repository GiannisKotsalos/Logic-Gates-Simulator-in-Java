Features:

1.Modular Gates: Individual classes for different logic gates (AND, NOR, OR, XOR).

2.Circuit Configuration: Define the circuit layout in a text file (circuit.txt).

3.User Interaction: Accepts boolean input values for specific gates.

4.Dynamic Output: Displays the results of the logic gate operations.

How to Use:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.

2.Compile and run the main program (LogicGatesSimIteration3.java).

3.Input boolean values as prompted and observe the circuit's behavior.


In this code:

input1x and input1y represent the row and column, respectively, of the first input for the  gate.

input2x and input2y represent the row and column, respectively, of the second input for the  gate.

These variables are then used in the calcOutput method to access the corresponding boolean values in the bbholes 2D array. The result is calculated based on the logical AND operation between the values at the specified input coordinates.
